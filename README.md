# meaning-of-equation-line

An interactive visualizer for understanding the line equation y = mx + b.

## Features

- Interactive slope (m) and y-intercept (b) controls
- Real-time graph updates
- Visual representation of the line on a coordinate plane
- Explanatory text that updates based on the current values
- Highlighted y-intercept point

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Adjust the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) values using the input fields
3. Watch the line update in real-time on the graph
4. Read the explanations below the graph to understand the meaning of each parameter

## Understanding the Equation

- **Slope (m)**: Determines the steepness and direction of the line
  - Positive: Line rises from left to right
  - Negative: Line falls from left to right
  - Zero: Horizontal line
- **Y-Intercept (b)**: The point where the line crosses the y-axis

The equation y = mx + b represents a straight line where:
- For every unit increase in x, y changes by m units
- The line passes through the point (0, b) on the y-axis
